  <h1>The World Wide Web & HTML</h1>
  <h2>Important Concepts</h2>

  <h3>World Wide Web</h3>
  <ul><li>A collection of HTML documents made up of 
  <b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage</li>
    <li>Everything found online (docs., images, videos)
    is glued together by HTML</li>
<li>Hyper <b>Links</b> connect all the HTML documents 
together making the World Wide
Web, <em>web</em>-like</li></ul>

<b>How It Works</b>
<p>I open my favorite <b>browser</b> and and type in 
www.Udacity.com and hit go. My browser sends a request via 
the Internet using a protocol called HTTP to the 
<b>servers</b> hosting Udacity's files. The servers
respond with the requested files, which my browser then 
displays. For more information, check out

<h3>HTML</h3>
<p>HTML is made up of 4 important components:</p>
<ol><li>Text Content (The actual text you see.) </li>
  <li>Markup (How the text looks, color, arangment, etc.)</li>
  <li>References to Other Documents (Images, 
  Videos, Games etc.)</li>
  <li>Links to Other Pages (Hence, the 
  <em>web</em>-like structure.)</li>
</ol>
<b>HTML Markup</b>
<p>HTML Markup is made up of <b>tags</b>. These tags
tell the computer <em>how</em> to display the text. A tag 
<em>usually</em> consists of both an opening and a closing tag,
with the contents in between, and the entire entity is
referred to as an <b>element</b>. Some tags, like the 
image tag, do not contain any text content to be displayed 
and therefore do not have an end tag. 
A tag can have none, one, or multiple
<b>attributes</b> inside of it. <a href = "https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444">
This Video</a> gives a good overview.</p>
<b>Inline v.s. Block Elements</b>
<p>HTML elements can be either inline, or block. Block elements 
form an invisible box around the contents inside of them. 
This box can be adjusted in both height and width. Inline 
elements simply appear in line with the text.

<h3>Think Like A Programmer</h3>
<p>Thinking like a programmer involves: </p>
<ol>
<li>Procedural Thinking:</li>
<p>Taking a big problem and breaking the solution down into 
  a set of steps.</p>
  <li>Abstract Thinking:</li>
  <p>Creating generalizations or finding similarities
    between seemingly unrelated things. </p>
    <li>Systematic De-Bugging:</li>
    <p>Systematically identifying problems and tracking 
      down their solution.</p>
      <li>Technological Empathy:</li>
      <p>Understanding how a computer sees things.</p>
      <li>Systems Thinking:</li>
      <p>Taking a big idea and breaking it down into its
        component pieces.
      </p>
  </ol>
